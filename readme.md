# YelpCamp - The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021
YelpCamp is a project conceived by Colt Steele, and is part of [The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).
It uses different tools, that are explored during the course, as **Bootstrap, Express, Passport, MongoDB, Mongoose, JOI, Cloudinary, Mapbox** and others.
This repository is intended to store my project, which was entirely based on Colt's.
His courses are widely recommended, and properly so.
